# Comp424-Project-Server
You will prepare a web server on the latest version of Ubuntu (a Linux distribution) along with necessary security tools to protect it from popular at tacks using the most popular firewall (IPTables) and intrusion detection system  (Snort). Note that the web server is also a SSH server, so you are required to install OpenSSH, and allow SSH traffic  to go through as well. You will install, configure, and implement your designed policies using these two security tools. You are required to install LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP stack) on Ubuntu with necessary  configurations suitable for your design and implementation. You will write two shell scripts to auto mate the installation and configuration of your system for disaster recovery  purposes with comments for every single command:  installation.sh: It will include all the commands regarding installation of all the necessary services and tools. Also,  all confi guration scripts for LAMP. implementation.sh: It will include all the commands regarding implementing policies for your firewall, IDS, etc.  You may use a stream editor such as “sed” to implement them using your automated scripts, if that requires editing  s pecific files.
